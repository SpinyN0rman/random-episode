# Random episode
A hobby project to return a random episode 
of any show using thetvdb.com.

The live site can be found at [randomepisode.northrop.uk](https://randomepisode.northrop.uk).

The basic version of the site uses the [TVDB's API](https://thetvdb.com/api-information) to allow users to search for 
a show. After selecting their chosen show we pick a random episode from the available seasons and episodes.
